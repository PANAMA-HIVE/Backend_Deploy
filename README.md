<h1>PANAMA-HIVE Backend Deployment for Testing purposes.</h1>
<h2>Presented by PANAMA-Hive</h2>
<p>The backend is deployed and live at: <strong>https://backend-deploy-1lzk.onrender.com/</strong></p>

<h2>Note-</h2>
<p>Since, this is a free instance. Sometimes the render instance takes 50 seconds to cold start.</p>
<p>Which can result in an API call taking 50 seconds. After the cold start it is instant.</p>
<p>This is really good for testing.</p>
<p>To prevent it from sleeping, I've added a cron job. (Scheduled API caller). It sometimes fails.</p>
